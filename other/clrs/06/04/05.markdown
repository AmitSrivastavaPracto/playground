Calling `MAX-HEAPIFY` in the loop of `HEAPSORT` always performs at least
`A.heap-size - 1` exchanges. This is due to the max-heap property - the element
at the last position is smaller than at least half of the other elements in the
heap. When moved to the first position, it will have to be pushed down to a
leaf position (half of the nodes are leaves) which is at least $h - 1$
exchanges, where $h$ is the height of the heap. Thus:

$$ \sum_{i=2}^{n}\lfloor\lg{i}\rfloor
     > \sum_{i=2}^{n}\lg(i-1)
     = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\lg{i}
     = \lg\Big((i-1)!\Big)
     = \Omega(n\lg{n}) $$
