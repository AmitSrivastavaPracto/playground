## Graphviz

I spend a lot of time playing with graphviz and it is a love-hate relationship. You can get a lot of thins draw, but unfortunatelly, you cannot get them drawn beautifully. It's very awkward at times and depends on weird conventions in the language (like catalog_ in the subgraphs). Finally, I managed to segfault it on multiple occasions.
