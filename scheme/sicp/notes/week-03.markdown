# Week 3 (2012-03-13 - 2012-03-20)

This is the third week of our humble study group. Some of us are lagging behind, but nontheless, we decided that we will complete Chapter 1.

## Meetup summary

It was rather quick. I found out that some of my thoughts were utterly invalid and that some of my solutions were wrong. Here are some assorted thouhgts:

* Plamen claims that it is proven that n.log(n) is the fastest a sorting algorithm can get. I'm not so certain about this, but hey - what do I know about sorting.
* I should check out what Radix sort is. It is purported to be constrained, but faster.
* My note from Week 1 on tail recursion + normal-order evaluation needs some clarification. I claimed that the time gets worse when both are present. It is actually not true, since normal-order evaluation is sufficient to degrade performance. Tail recursion is a factor, however, in the way you write programs. I would claim that if you had no tail recursion in your language, you would not go with a recursive procedure. Therefore, it is very unlikely that you stumble in that kind of degradation. Normal-order would still be slower, however.
* I got 1.15 wrong. Time is Î˜(logn).
* I sill have questions from earlier. I will not carry them over to Chapter 2, but I will still keep them around in hope that somebody would provide a satisfactory answer.

## Questions

* What is the time complexity of 1.14?
* What is the time complexity of normal-order in 1.20?
* Am I getting the Robin-Miller test from 1.28 wrong? I expected all numbers a < n to fail the simple test (the one without the non-trivial square root test).
* In 1.29, my implementation of Simpson's rule appears to be less precise. Am I doing something wrong?

## Ruby, lambdas and procedures as general methods

Chapter 1.3.3 makes a very nice point about procedures. When a procedure is parametrized with functions (as opposed to values), it can create a more powerful abstraction. The `fixed-point` function is a nice example of that - it is a general abstraction for Newton's method of finding square roots (exercise 1.07). This is cool, but I would say that it is not used in Ruby.

Ruby is pretty decent, when your method needs just one lambda - it can be passed as a block. When you need too lambdas, however, it becomes rather awkward. Ruby has the `lambda` keyword, but it has at least two problems - (1) mullti-ine lambdas are tricky (you have to use `{`/`}` instead of `do`/`end`) and (2) it feels awkward to pass lambdas to functions an invoke them. In such cases, I would probably go with a Template Method instead.

While Ruby has all the power and flexibility to do this, I feel that the Ruby culture frowns upon it. Thus, Ruby feels less powerful in that sense. Note that it just **feels** that way.
