# Week 1 (2012-02-27 - 2012-03-06)

Notes on my first week with SICP. We have just started the study group.

## Questions

* Is [Nikolay's `good-enough?`][nb-01-07] different?
* What is the time complexity of 1.14?

## Various

* I enjoy writing text on the side of the code. I don't do that in my day job, since I consider it an anti-pattern. It makes me more reflective.
* I enjoy reaching a certain depth in my fiddling with Scheme. It makes the experience nicer.
* I take a lot of time to ensure nice commit message and nice looking solutions. That way the code should be a pleasure to read.
* Consider giving me the thumbs up, if you are following along and enjoying it ;)
* Building tools is interesting, although it turned into yak shaving - I spent and hour and something on the Rakefile.

## How to Design Programs

The Racket community has its own introductory-level book that teaches Scheme (called [How to Design Programs](http://htdp.org/). It takes a different approach from SICP and even criticizes it a bit. It looks promising - it is using DrRacket a lot and it even combines pictures and code in a cool way.

The book is even more basic than SICP, which doesn't make it very interesting to me. Besides, the point of the study group is to finish SICP, not HtDP. I might take a look at it once we're finished.

## Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming

There is another book that looks promising - [Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming][ctm]. It is dubbed by some people as "the book to read after SICP". It looks promising and there are some [nice comments about it on c2][ctm-on-c2]. I learned about it form a [thread on Hacker News][sicp-vs-htdp-hn] that is also worth taking a look at.

## Why MIT switched from Scheme to Python?

Sussman has an [interesting comment][why-python] on why MIT switched to Python. It is short and I cannot pick up a representative quote. To sum it up, programming has changed fundamentally and while in the past you could understand your program all the way down, now you have to do basic science on some of the libraries you are using. Definitelly worth reading it.
