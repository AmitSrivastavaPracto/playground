# Week 08 (2012-04-17 - 2012-04-24)

## Notes

* My estimate on 2.43 is a bit off. I should check or ask around.
* I'm testing 2.44 in a funky way. I'm replacing below and besides with procedures that construct lists and am asserting on the resulting list.
* Racket has a plt-r5rs executable. Maybe I can use it instead?
