# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

I'm doing a SICP study group with a couple of friends. This is where I will
kepp the solutions to the exercises.

## Scheme implementation

Despite this being SICP, I've chosen to use [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/).
The people there have their own opinion on how to do an introductionary course
in Scheme, called [How to Design Programs](http://www.htdp.org/). This is
beside the point, though - the idea here is to read through SICP, not to learn
Scheme or programming.

At the time, Racket does not have a decent sicp language pack. Instead of
trying to figure out a way to restrict the language, I will try to stick at
the R5S5 subset, using Racket. If that fails for some reason, I might
reconsider.
