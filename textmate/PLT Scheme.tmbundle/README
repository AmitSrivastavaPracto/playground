I decided to switch from Vim to TextMate when playing with PLT Scheme. Since
I wanted to learn about making TextMate bundles, I decided to let go of the
Scheme bundle and create one of my own for the experience.

You should definitelly not use this. I'm adding only stuff that I need. Since
I am using a subset of the language (a rather weird one, I might add), you'll
get strange highlighting, lack of features and so on.

TextMate has a nice Scheme bundle, that I'm shamelessly ripping code off (to
give credit where due). You can find it here:
